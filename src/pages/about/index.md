### Local Products
We believe food makes people happy and brings people together. We also believe in supporting local businesses and not having our products travel very far for optimal freshness. That's why we try our best to support North Carolina breweries, wineries and food producers.

### Fresh Kegs
We use Untappd to show how fresh our kegs our. Check out our "beer" tab to view our full selection of local and domestioc kegs.

### Open Draft
Our bar has an open draft section where you can sample which beer suits your tastebuds.

### Direct sourcing
Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some breweries. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and hop farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality.

### Supporting local businesses
We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing products to you. That’s why we try to support as many local farms, local businesses and breweries as possible. You can see the communities grow and learn more about beer on our blog.
